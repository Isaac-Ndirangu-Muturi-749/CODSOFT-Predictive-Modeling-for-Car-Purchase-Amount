## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the car purchase amount a customer is likely to spend based on various customer attributes. Understanding and predicting customer behavior in terms of car purchases is crucial for automotive companies to tailor their marketing strategies, optimize sales efforts, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Business Goals

The primary business goals of this project are as follows:

1. **Accurate Predictions:** Develop a predictive model with high accuracy to estimate car purchase amounts. Accurate predictions will enable the company to better allocate resources and optimize inventory management.

2. **Customer Segmentation:** Identify and understand customer segments based on their demographics, income levels, and other attributes. This will help in creating targeted marketing campaigns and product offerings.

3. **Marketing Strategy:** Use insights from the model to develop and refine marketing strategies. Understand which customer groups are more likely to make high-value car purchases and tailor advertising accordingly.

4. **Sales Optimization:** Optimize sales efforts by focusing on potential high-value customers. Provide sales teams with valuable insights to enhance their interactions with customers.

5. **Customer Satisfaction:** Enhance the overall customer experience by offering personalized services and recommendations based on predicted car purchase amounts.

## Data Sources

The project will rely on a dataset containing historical customer data. This dataset includes information such as customer demographics, annual income, credit card debt, net worth, and email domains. The dataset will be used to train and test the predictive model.

## Methodology

The project will follow these key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset will be cleaned and prepared for analysis. This includes handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explore the dataset to gain insights into customer behavior and relationships between variables. EDA will inform feature selection and model development.

3. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.

4. **Model Development:** Build predictive models using regression techniques. Evaluate the models for accuracy and choose the most suitable one for car purchase predictions.

5. **Regularization:** Apply regularization techniques like Lasso or Ridge regression to prevent overfitting and enhance model interpretability.

6. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the chosen model using appropriate metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.

7. **Feature Importance:** Identify the most important features contributing to car purchase predictions.

8. **Business Insights:** Translate model results into actionable business insights and recommendations.

## Expected Outcomes

The expected outcomes of this project include:

- A predictive model capable of estimating car purchase amounts accurately.
- Insights into customer segments and their preferences.
- Enhanced marketing and sales strategies.
- Improved customer satisfaction and personalized services.

By achieving these outcomes, the company can make data-driven decisions to boost sales and customer engagement while optimizing resources effectively.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, etc.)


### Data Sources

The dataset used in this project was obtained from [kaggle/https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yashpaloswal/ann-car-sales-price-prediction].

### Data Description

The dataset contains information on customers, including features such as age, annual salary, credit card debt, net worth, and more. The target variable is "car purchase amount."

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA process involved exploring the dataset, visualizing relationships between features, and gaining insights into the data.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps included handling missing values, outliers, and data cleaning.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering techniques were applied to create relevant features from the existing dataset.

## Model Building

### Linear Regression

A linear regression model was built to predict car purchase amounts.

### Regularization (Ridge and Lasso)

Regularization techniques, including Ridge and Lasso regression, were employed to prevent overfitting and improve model interpretability.



## Model Evaluation

Various metrics and evaluation results were generated to assess model performance.

## Feature Importance

The most important features contributing to car purchase predictions were identified.


## Recommendations

Based on our analysis and modeling, we can provide the following recommendations:

1. **Feature Importance:** Pay close attention to the most important features identified by the Lasso Regression model, which include `age`, `annual Salary`, and `net worth`. These features have the highest impact on predicting the car purchase amount.

2. **Age and Income:** It is evident that age and income are significant factors in determining the car purchase amount. Consider tailoring marketing and sales strategies to specific age groups and income levels to optimize sales.

3. **Continental Insights:** While continent-based one-hot encoding did not yield significant coefficients, it may still be valuable for regional marketing efforts or understanding global trends. Further exploration may reveal continent-specific insights.

4. **Regularization:** Continue to use Lasso Regression for its feature selection capabilities and regularization to prevent overfitting. The selected alpha value of 0.1 performed well and should be maintained.

5. **Customer Segmentation:** Consider creating customer segments based on age, income, and other significant features. This can help in targeted advertising and product offerings.

## Conclusions

In conclusion, our analysis and modeling efforts have provided valuable insights into predicting car purchase amounts based on customer attributes. We have identified key features such as age, annual salary, and net worth as crucial factors in making accurate predictions.

The Lasso Regression model with an alpha value of 0.1 proved to be the most effective in this scenario, resulting in a low root mean squared error (RMSE) and high R-squared value, indicating a strong fit to the data.

Understanding customer demographics and income levels is essential for tailoring marketing and sales strategies. Additionally, regularized regression techniques help in feature selection and preventing overfitting, making them valuable tools in predictive modeling.

Continued data collection and analysis will further enhance our ability to make accurate predictions and drive informed business decisions.
